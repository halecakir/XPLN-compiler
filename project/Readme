Status:
ALL XPLN requirements is implemented.

How to run:
first:
    ex-expr.lexer exNUM > exNUM_tokens
then from yalalr:
    (load "ex-expr")
    (make-lalrparser)
    (target-code-mips "exNUM_tokens" t)


Sample codes:

ex1: factorial of given number in a recursive way
ex2: high order function with multiple argument
ex3: mixed tests ( multiple function, for loop )
ex4: nested for loop vs nested while loop ( they are doing the same thing)
ex5: associativity and precedence
ex6: function without return statement (hence, error reported)
ex7: if statements
ex8: lexical scope test
